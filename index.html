									<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
									<p>I am interested in programming, computer systems and AI. When I was very young my parents bought me a gameboy advance. This kindled my initial interest in games and computers. I saved and bought an original iPad with my parents help. I briefly experimented with python on that iPad. Many years later, I designed a custom computer. I took 1 year of IB HL computer science but moved before being able to completing year 2.
										I chose RMIT because the campus is great and the open day gave me the impression that the uni felt modern and interesting.
										<br>
										In this course I expect to learn about programming and IT systems as well as career development.

									<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
									<p>https://jobs.lever.co/flyzipline/
										<br>
										Zipline is a company that builds, programs, and operates drones that deliver blood and plasma for transfusion in Rwandan hospitals. Because the roads there are underdeveloped and are often flooded or inaccessible, drones allow the blood to be centrally stored and transferred when needed which leads to less waste and less shortages.
										<br>
										They are offering entry level positions so the experience I would need is to complete my degree at the very least. I think delving into aerophysics somewhat in order to understand the drone systems would also be valuable.
										<br>
										I am currently in my second semester of my first year of university. In order to attain the necessary qualifications I would have to complete my degree and possibly a masters.
										<br>
										I am not sure exactly what position is suitable for me yet but I would love to work for this company. The technical problems seem interesting to solve as well as being involved in a company that is making a difference in countries with underdeveloped infrastructure.

									<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
									<p>Myers-Briggs: INFJ
										Analysis: My Myers-Briggs profile indicates that I am generally introverted, I derive my energy from time spent alone in quiet. I learn intuitively, trusting my prior experiences and internal process. I make decisions and cope with emotions through feeling, using my emotional perspective rather than a strict logic. Finally I approach the world through judging although it was close to 50%-50% in this category. These traits make me a methodical, internal worker who prefers to make my own progress rather than have many external factors influencing me. Of course in the workplace this isn’t a totally realistic expectation and knowing my inclination to self-isolation, I should make an effort to externalise my work. I also think it is valuable to lean into my personality as well though. By giving myself private uninterrupted time to focus I can complete a lot more than in a highly interactive environment.
										<br>
										<br>
										Learning Style: Tactile
										Analysis: I heavily favour a tactile style of learning. I learn by interaction and doing things myself rather than being told or shown. I can utilize this to my advantage by practicing and learning with my own hands as much as possible. In situations where I have to be told or shown what to do I can associate the knowledge with tactile feelings by using physical learning aids such as typing on a computer or keeping parts of my body moving. It also indicates that frequent short breaks are beneficial to my concentration by I should be wary of taking too long breaks.
										<br>
										<br>
										Sixteen Personalities: INFJ-A (Advocate)
										Analysis: Although similar to the Myers-Briggs test, the sixteen personality test ascribes a more combined idea of the different elements of the personality type. The advocate is a personality described as having a strong internal morality and idealism. They are also motivated to actually pursue those ideals rather than dream about them. Although they tend to be quiet, they have strong opinions are highly motivated and dedicated to them. These traits indicate to me that I should seek opportunities where I am improving the world and align with my sense of morality. Finding an environment where I can shape the world with my idealism would be good for my personal motivation and happiness.

									<h2>My Projects</h2>
									I am currently working on a small game for PC’s. It is a management game where you are a newly sentient AI in a future version of our solar system where humans have colonized many of the other planets. The gameplay consists of piloting a ship around the solar system to trade and interact with the many varied outpost of humanity. It has elements of hard science fiction and simulation but will be simplified to remain accessible. There is no set objective for the game other than to survive and explore. The game is not intended to be 3D rendered or first person, instead everything will be presented from the perspective of the player’s AI character. In this way I can avoid the difficulties of having to model and animate things in a 3D space. Most of the game can be presented from a fixed 2D perspective of menus and maps. Currently the project has a fairly small scope as I mainly want to learn from the experience but it is possible to expand on the concept as much or little as I would like. The main elements of the game that I would like to create are: a simulated solar system with accurate orbits and timescale as well as having settlements for the player to land in and interact with, ships whose flight paths are modeled based on actual space travel (ie not directly planet to planet but with gravity boosts and timing based off of orbit windows), an interactive economy between market that the player can trade with, a combat system that creates tense consequential action and a stock of ships to purchase, customize, and pilot. Although these are the primary elements I believe are important to the game, it is the atmosphere and storytelling that are at its heart. The game is intended to to feel thoughtful and relaxing to play with incremental gain of resources. The immersion of the player in the fiction of the game will be the main draw of the game as well as an interesting evolving puzzle from the simulated economy.
									<br>
									The game is currently in the planning stage so I haven’t committed to any one game engine yet although godot and gamemaker studio are quite appealing. I will need a system to test write and test it on but as the game shouldn’t be too taxing my laptop will likely be enough for those purposes. The game itself will have to be written and scripted as well as any assets such as images, models, or audio. These requirements are all feasible in reach, so progress on the project will not be hindered by those factors unless I want professionally created assets.
									<br>
									Although it depends on the engine I use, I will have to familiarize myself with a proprietary language or one used by the game engine, like C#. Project planning and game design principles are also important for this project and although I am inexperienced in both, I am using this as an opportunity to learn exactly those things. It may also be possible that I will need some graphics and animation skills, which I would also have to learn but I am hopeful that I will be able to work with other people who specialise in that. Again overall these seem feasible and require only time to learn and execute, aside from the visual and audio assets.
									<br>
									The main outcome of this project would be a completed game that is playable and hopefully enjoyable. Depending on the extent that the project is taken, it could even be marketable on a platform such as steam or itch.io. However the main purpose of this project is to familiarise myself with project planning and management as well as the principles of game design in practice. I want to use the opportunity to expand my portfolio of skills and establish a point of reference for my ability in the future. In theory I will learn many things from this project and also have a compelling game as evidence.
									<br>
									I am not sure exactly what position is suitable for me yet but I would love to work for this company. The technical problems seem interesting to solve as well as being involved in a company that is making a difference in countries with underdeveloped infrastructure.
