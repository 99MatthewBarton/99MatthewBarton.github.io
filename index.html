							<h1>Matthew Barton</h1>
							<p>I was born in Melbourne, Australia, started moving for dad’s job at age 5, lived in Lagos, Nigeria; Houston, Texas; Doha, Qatar. I speak English and a splash of French and Chinese. I ran cross-country in highschool and competed internationally. Currently I am enrolled in a Bachelor of Computer Studies at RMIT.</a></p>

									<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
									<p>I am interested in programming, computer systems and AI. When I was very young my parents bought me a gameboy advance. This kindled my initial interest in games and computers. I saved and bought an original iPad with my parents help. I briefly experimented with python on that iPad. Many years later, I designed a custom computer. I took 1 year of IB HL computer science but moved before being able to completing year 2.
										I chose RMIT because the campus is great and the open day gave me the impression that the uni felt modern and interesting.
										In this course I expect to learn about programming and IT systems as well as career development.

									<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
									<p>https://jobs.lever.co/flyzipline/
										Zipline is a company that builds, programs, and operates drones that deliver blood and plasma for transfusion in Rwandan hospitals. Because the roads there are underdeveloped and are often flooded or inaccessible, drones allow the blood to be centrally stored and transferred when needed which leads to less waste and less shortages.
										They are offering entry level positions so the experience I would need is to complete my degree at the very least. I think delving into aerophysics somewhat in order to understand the drone systems would also be valuable.
										I am currently in my second semester of my first year of university. In order to attain the necessary qualifications I would have to complete my degree and possibly a masters.
										I am not sure exactly what position is suitable for me yet but I would love to work for this company. The technical problems seem interesting to solve as well as being involved in a company that is making a difference in countries with underdeveloped infrastructure.

									<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
									<p>Myers-Briggs: INFJ
										Analysis: My Myers-Briggs profile indicates that I am generally introverted, I derive my energy from time spent alone in quiet. I learn intuitively, trusting my prior experiences and internal process. I make decisions and cope with emotions through feeling, using my emotional perspective rather than a strict logic. Finally I approach the world through judging although it was close to 50%-50% in this category. These traits make me a methodical, internal worker who prefers to make my own progress rather than have many external factors influencing me. Of course in the workplace this isn’t a totally realistic expectation and knowing my inclination to self-isolation, I should make an effort to externalise my work. I also think it is valuable to lean into my personality as well though. By giving myself private uninterrupted time to focus I can complete a lot more than in a highly interactive environment.
										<br>
										Learning Style: Tactile
										Analysis: I heavily favour a tactile style of learning. I learn by interaction and doing things myself rather than being told or shown. I can utilize this to my advantage by practicing and learning with my own hands as much as possible. In situations where I have to be told or shown what to do I can associate the knowledge with tactile feelings by using physical learning aids such as typing on a computer or keeping parts of my body moving. It also indicates that frequent short breaks are beneficial to my concentration by I should be wary of taking too long breaks.
										<br>
										Sixteen Personalities: INFJ-A (Advocate)
										Analysis: Although similar to the Myers-Briggs test, the sixteen personality test ascribes a more combined idea of the different elements of the personality type. The advocate is a personality described as having a strong internal morality and idealism. They are also motivated to actually pursue those ideals rather than dream about them. Although they tend to be quiet, they have strong opinions are highly motivated and dedicated to them. These traits indicate to me that I should seek opportunities where I am improving the world and align with my sense of morality. Finding an environment where I can shape the world with my idealism would be good for my personal motivation and happiness.
